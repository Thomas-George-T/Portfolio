We conduct a Data Science experiment *(of sorts)* where we compare and benchmark popular languages and execution engines. We find out which languages among **Java**, **Scala** and **Python** is the quickest or slowest. Similarly, we compare and benchmark execution engines like **Hadoop** and **Spark**.

**Observations**

For programming languages, we observe that Python has the least execution time for small and large files while Scala has the largest execution time. Interestingly, Scala takes 7 seconds more for processing the small file rather than the larger file.

For execution engines, we observe that the Spark engine has the least execution time while Hadoopâ€™s Mapreduce engine has the highest execution time. This is in line with the claim that Spark is 100 times quicker than Hadoop.
